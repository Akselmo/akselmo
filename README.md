# Hi, I'm Akseli! 
I'm just a gamedev and Linux/FOSS nerd. My dayjob title is stability engineer.

I like to contribute to open source projects, whether it's bug reports or code!

I'm always looking for projects to contribute in, so if you need help in something, feel free to ask. Maybe I can have a crack at it.

## Notable projects:

I'm currently working on [Artificial-Rage](https://github.com/Akselmo/Artificial-Rage)!

If you play Elder Scrolls Online on Linux, check out [ESO Linux Addon Manager](https://github.com/Akselmo/ESOLinuxAddonManager)!
