# Hi, I'm Akseli! 
During the day I work on KDE development, and as my hobby I make games and other funky projects.

I like to contribute to open source projects, whether it's bug reports or code!

## Notable projects:

- [Artificial-Rage](https://codeberg.org/akselmo/Artificial-Rage)
  - Simple FPS game I'm making with C, using Raylib library. Work in progress!
- [ESO Linux Addon Manager](https://codeberg.org/akselmo/ESOLinuxAddonManager)
  - Addon "manager" for Elder Scrolls Online. Currently just downloads addons from list of URL's.
  - Current iteration made with Python and GTK.
- [Revontuli](https://codeberg.org/akselmo/Revontuli)
  - A color scheme that is shared between multiple editors, tools, etc..
  - Also for KDE Plasma desktop!
